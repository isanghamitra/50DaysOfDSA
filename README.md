# 50 Days Of DSA

My #100daysofcode journey ended on a great note. With new enthusiasm, I am commiting to another challenge. I have been procrastinating over brushing up my Data Structures and Algorithms notes for a long time. I think it's the best time to start with #50daysofDSA with C++.

Why Data Structures and Algorithms?
Data structure and algorithms help in understanding the nature of the problem at a deeper level and thereby increases our problem solving ability.
